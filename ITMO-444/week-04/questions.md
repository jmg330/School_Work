# Chapter 2 Designing for Operations

Place your answers below each question.  Answer are found directly in the text.

1. Why is design for operations so important?

Design operations are important because it allows companies to scale their designs in a quick and efficient manner. A design team can also help to make workflows more efficient thus reducing the overall development time for the DevOps team. 

2. How is automated configuration typically supported?

Automated Configuration is typically managed by configuration management tools such as Red Hat Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. This helps to ensure that software is configured correctly and consistently across a system's design. 

3. List the important factors for redundancy through replication.

The importance of redundancy through replication is achieved by having multiple backups for the same task or process. The reason this is so important is that if one or more of the processes were to fail, there would be multiple backup processes on standby ready to take their place. 

4. Why might you not want to solve an issue by coding the solution yourself?

The reason you may not want to initially solve a software issue by coding yourself is that humans are significantly more prone to making errors than machines or programs. Additionally, if youâ€™re trying to troubleshoot a more complex program, chances are there will be thousands of lines of code you would need to sift through to even attempt to solve the issue.

5. Which type of problems should appear first on your priority list?

In a professional setting, problems that directly affect the end-user or customer take the highest priority to get fixed. In regards to design, a problem that has a significant negative effect on the workflow would also be a top priority issue. 

6. Which factors can you bring to an outside vendor to get the vendor to take your issue seriously?

Write detailed explanations of the issue you are having. Additionally, writing a postmortem report that includes the feature request so that the vendor can see the context of the request.
