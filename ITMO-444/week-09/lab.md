# Week-07 Lab

## Objectives

* Install and Configure our NodeJS application allowing uploading of images
* Create, install, and deploy a MariaDB database using Amazon RDS
* Create and deploy additional storage using Amazon Elastic Block Storage
* Create and deploy S3 based bucket storage
* Clone an application from your private GitHub repo into an EC2 instance
* Destroy all resources via single shell script -- using queries and filters to dynamically discover your resources
* **Graduates** - Use the IAM profile to grant your EC2 instance permission to use other AWS resources on your behalf

## Outcomes

At the conclusion of this 2-week lab you will have successfully deployed and destroyed a single-tier cloud application via the AWS CLI and using positional parameters in a shell script.  You will also experience using IAM profiles to create least privileges.  You will have configured your application to use AWS CLI Filters and Queries to retrieve dynamic data about ephemeral instances.

## Assumptions

For this assignment you can make these assumptions

* Start by copying any code from lab week-06 directly into week-07 and work from there
* Add the filename `arguments.txt` to your `.gitignore` file
* In this initial version we will hard-code the database password

## Deliverable

Create a folder named: week-06 under your class folder in the provided private repo. In the folder there will be three shell scripts:

* A script named: `create-env.sh`
  * This script will create an EC2 instance
* A script named: `install-env.sh`
  * This script installs an NodeJS ExpressJS server on launch
* A script named: `destroy-env.sh`
  * This script will terminate all infrastructure you have created

### create-env.sh

This is shell script will take commandline input dynamically via positional parameters ($1 $2 $3 and so on) via a file named `arguments.txt`.  For a refresh on positional parameters [see my text book](https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1/releases/tag/2021-09-29 "Link to Linux Textbook") starting on page 179 PDF.

```./create-env.sh $(<arguments.txt)```

### arguments.txt

This is where you will pass the arguments (space delimited) as follows (order is **very** important)

* image-id
* instance-type
* count
* subnet-id
* key-name
* security-group-ids
* user-data

I will grade your logic by running it with my account configuration information, no hard-coded values.

### install-env.sh

This will contain the same content as last week's assignment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apache2
# Or if you would like to do nginx you can do that 
# sudo apt-get install y nginx
```

### destroy-env.sh

Using AWS CLI v2 filters filter the instance you created and destroy it.  A single running of `destroy-env.sh` will terminate all of the resources that your `install-env.sh` script launched.

## Final Deliverable

Submit the URL to the week-06 folder to Blackboard.  Your week-06 repo will contain all three shell scripts but not the **arguments.txt** file.
